# About

I built this site mainly to use as my notes. However, I wanted to build a public resource that, hopefully, provides value to anyone in the cyber, or a cyber adjacent, field. Someday, I hope to have a comprehensive, easy to navigate, quick to use site containing everything you need for your cyber operations or studies.

## Content Principles

I try my hardest to break down content into it's most useful parts using MOCs (Maps of Content). Essentially, a MOC is used as a map for related content so that the navigation bar isn't flooded with irrelevant pages. You dial down to the relevant MOC, and from there, to the relevant page containing the data, or sometimes, another MOC if necessary.

## Influences & Attributions

Being in cyber and using many of the available resources on the internet, I will probably be copying or rewriting some of that content to fit within the organization of this site. For any of these sites that allow me the ability to do so without rewriting the content myself, I will list below to give proper attribution.
