# **SH3LL**

I'm a recent college graduate, working full-time as a Systems and Network Admin II. Check out my [blog](https://infophreak.com/author/sh3ll/). I am building a cyber community of like-minded, passionate individuals looking to learn and help others achieve their goals. The community is called [Infophreak](https://infophreak.com/) and we are a community-driven cybersecurity project. Feel free to join our [discord](https://discord.gg/infophreak) and join us for our frequent hangouts. We will generally work together on CTFs or personal/community projects. Also, quite a few of us are big-time gamers and always down for a good time. Do not hesitate to offer a hand if you like what we do. We could use all the help we can get. We also compete in CTF competitions, and anyone serious about learning and growing is more than welcome to join us.

Additionally, I am a single Christian father working in a small family IT business. I'm a man of traditional family values and try to be the best, loving human being I can be. My personal interests include gaming, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, making music, fishing, and eating... lol

I hope you find value in my content and our community. I am also always open to constructive criticism and feedback. Moreover, if you have any topics you want me to cover, please get in touch with me on Discord.
